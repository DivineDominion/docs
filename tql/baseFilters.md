description: Specifies the default filters to be attached to a query before executing it in the TelemetryDeck Query Language.
lead: Specifies the default filters to be attached to a query before executing it.
order: 140

The filters generated by this rule are combined with a query's `filter` property using an `and` filter.

The default value is `thisOrganization`.

## Example

```json
{
  "baseFilters": "thisOrganization"
}
```

## Possible Values

[`thisOrganization`](/docs/tql/thisorganization/)
: Attach test mode filter and filter for all apps of the executing user's organization.

[`thisApp`](/docs/tql/thisapp/)
: Attach test mode filter and filter for the app the insight lives in. If the query does not belong to an insight, this value requires the query's `appID` property to be set.

[`exampleData`](/docs/tql/exampledata/)
: Attach test mode filter and filter for the example app's data. The server will execute this query as if the owner of the Example App is logged in, and it will always return example data instead of an actual user's data. This is great for showing a demo of the environment.
