In TelemetryDeck, every member is part of an **organization**. If you are not working on your own and have at least one other person joining you on the work of your app, you might be interested in adding them to your organization. With separate accounts for each member, everyone will be able to get access to the insights whenever they need them.
Adding members to your organization lets you share groups and insights with them so that everyone can have a look at the latest data.
You can collaborate with your team, giving them more insight on - well - insights! And of course your members can work with real-life data and get instant feedback on their changes.


## Navigate To Your Organization Settings

To add someone to your organization, you first need to create an account. If you have not created an account and named your organization yet, check out our guide [Making an Account](/docs/articles/making-account/) first.

In your browser, navigate to the [dashboard](https://dashboard.telemetrydeck.com). There you will find your name on the top right side. Click on it to open the menu. Choose `Organization Settings` next.


## Adding a New User

Under `Members`, you can see a list of all the current members with their corresponding email addresses who are part of your organization. You should only see yourself on the list if you have not added anyone. To invite a user, navigate to `Invite Someone`. Add your new member's email address in the text field and click on `Invite`.

**We are now sending out an email** with a link to join your organization. Members of your organization get instant access to all apps and insight groups, which makes it easy to collaborate on new ideas and features!
