## The flow of your app
Whenever users use an app, they do so with an intend. This can be a simple look if there is anything new in the social media app, or ordering a product or service.
Sometimes they go directly to their goal, they do not pass go and they do not collect 200â‚¬ ðŸ˜‹. At other times, they wander off and get distracted before reaching their goal. And occasionally they even find hurdles and cancel before finishing the process at all.
These goals are often your goals, too. As the app owner, you want them to spent time in your app, find the new feature, and order that new product.

Funnels are a great way to show this kind of behavior. What funnels do at heart is simply displaying when exactly a user ends the process. For example it is possible to showcase each page of an app - from opening the home page to the finally checkout page. If you have 100 users going through that process, and all of them finish it, all steps should show 100 users.
If there happens to be some confusion during the process, and users cancel it before the checkout, you would see that the page causing that issue will leave a drop in users after that. The checkout page will probably show less than 100 users at the end.

Letâ€˜s have a look how to use funnels in TelemetryDeck.

## How to use funnels
Imagine you want to track how many users turn into customers. You can use funnels to track this conversion process. To track this funnel, you need to set up filters in your TelemetryDeck dashboard. These filters help you track how many users complete each step of the funnel.

For example, letâ€™s say your funnel has three steps:

1. Visiting the product page
2. Adding the product to the cart
3. Completing the checkout process

You can set up corresponding filters to track how many users complete each step of the funnel.

For the first step, you can filter the data to only show users who visited the product page. For the second step, you can filter the data to only show users who added the product to their cart after visiting the product page. For the third step, you can filter the data to only show users who completed the checkout process after adding the product to their cart.

By using filters to track each step of the funnel, you can see how many users make it through each step and where they drop off. This information can help you identify areas where you can improve your app to increase conversions!
