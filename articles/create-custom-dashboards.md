lead: Customizing your dashboard helps you get a better overview of the signals you are most interested in - so let's have a look at how to configure them!

## Step One: Create a New Group

By creating a group, you also create a **dashboard** simultaneously. To create a group, go to your [TelemetryDeck dashboard](https://dashboard.telemetrydeck.com/) and look at the left sidebar. Here you can find the `GROUPS` category. Click <kbd>+ New Group</kbd>, give your group a name and then click <kbd>Create</kbd>. You now have a new group in your sidebar!

## Step Two: Share Your Groups With Your Organization

You can easily share your created groups with the members of your organization. To do so, navigate to the group you want to share, and copy the URL. That's it! 
Each group has its own unique identifier, so the URL for every group in your organization is different, making it easy to quickly share new changes and new groups with your team.

## Step Three: Create and Delete Insights From Your Group

Now let's **create** an insight. While in your group, click the <kbd>+ Create new Insight</kbd> button. Please choose from one of our convenient templates! The insight will be automagically ✨ generated for you.
If needed, you can change the display mode, title, signal type, and more by clicking on your insight's name. You can create a bunch of insights for your group and thus, combine thematically related charts of your insights. You can also resize your charts to regular-sized or big and at the top.

To **delete** insights from your group, click on the insights' name. Under the `Meta` category, you can delete the current insight by clicking <kbd>Delete</kbd>.

## Step Four: Rename Your Group

Not happy with the name given to your group? No problem - you can change it quickly! Click on the group whose name you want to change. Then click on the `Edit` icon on the right side of your group's name. A small pop-up appears where you can change the name of your group. Just click <kbd>Save Changes</kbd> after you are done editing. Your group now has a new name.

---


## Step Five: Delete Your Group

If you don't need your group anymore, you can delete it. Deleting your group will also delete all created insights within it. As described in [Step Four](#step-four%3A-rename-your-group), go to your group's `Edit` section. Under the name-changing section, you will see a <kbd>Delete group and all its insights</kbd> button. After clicking the button, you are asked to confirm your choice since deleting a group isn't reversible. Click <kbd>Ok</kbd>, and your group is gone!
