## Create a new group

What we lovingly call our **Insight Groups**, other products might call that a "dashboard". To create an insight group, go to your [TelemetryDeck dashboard](https://dashboard.telemetrydeck.com/) and look at the left sidebar. Here you can find the `GROUPS` category. Create a _New Group_, give your group a name and then click _Create_. You now have a new insight group in your sidebar!

## Share your groups with your organization

Interested in how to add members to your organization? Check out our [helpful guide](/docs/articles/invite-members-to-organization/).

You can add other members to your organization in a fly. Your members instantly get access to all created insight groups! They can add, edit and delete dashboards - making it easy to work on your goals.
You can also share specific groups with the members of your organization. To do so, navigate to the group you want to share, and copy the URL.

## Manage your insight groups

### Create and delete insights from your group

Now let's **create** an insight. While in your group, click the _Create new Insight_ button and give your new insight a name. Please choose from one of our convenient templates! The insight will be automagically âœ¨ generated for you. If needed, you can also change the display mode, title, query type, and more - even after creating it.

You can create a bunch of insights for your group and thus, combine thematically related charts of your insights. And you're able to resize your charts to regular-sized `Compact` cards or big `Wide` cards.

To **delete** insights from your group, click on the insights' name. Go to `Actions` in the top right corner, just delete the current insight by clicking on "Delete Insight".

### Rename your group

Not happy with the name given to your group? No problem - you can change it quickly! Click on the group whose name you want to change. Then click on the `Edit` icon on the right side of your group's name. A small pop-up appears where you can change the name of your group. Save your changes after you are done editing - your group now has a new name.

### Delete your group

If you don't need your group anymore, you can delete it. Deleting your group will also **delete all created insights** within it. As described in [the previous step](#rename-your-group), go to your group's `Edit` section. Under the name-changing section, you will see a "_Delete group and all its insights_" button. After clicking the button, you are asked to confirm your choice since deleting a group isn't reversible. Click _Ok_, and your group is gone!
